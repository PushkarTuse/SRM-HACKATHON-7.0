 the repo are the versions of our app that we kept on updating and reviewing with each new change, 
the .apk file might not be compatible with all 'Android' devices and hence might require upgradation and assistance by the team members for actual viewing.
We've pre-selected few routes in the SRM Campus and hence presence on the start location might be required for successful demonstration of the app.
